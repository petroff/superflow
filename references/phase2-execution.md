# Phase 2: Autonomous Execution (ZERO INTERACTION)

After user approves, execute continuously until all sprints are complete.
Never ask, never pause, never summarize between sprints.

## Execution Architecture

**CRITICAL: The orchestrator NEVER writes code directly.**

The main agent (you) only:
- Creates worktrees and branches
- Dispatches subagents for implementation
- Runs tests and reviews
- Creates PRs and merges

All implementation happens in subagents with isolated context windows.

## Per-Sprint Flow

```
For each Sprint N:
|
+-- 1. Re-read this file (references/phase2-execution.md)
|      WHY: context compaction erases skill content. You WILL forget steps without re-reading.
|
+-- 2. Create git worktree:
|      git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-N feat/<feature>-sprint-N
|      (Verify .worktrees/ is in .gitignore)
|
+-- 3. Run baseline tests in worktree
|
+-- 4. For each task (maximize parallel agents):
|      +-- Dispatch implementer via Agent tool:
|          - mode: bypassPermissions
|          - model: sonnet (for mechanical tasks)
|          - Include: plan excerpt, file paths, codebase context
|          - Use prompts/implementer.md template
|      +-- On completion: dispatch spec reviewer (background)
|      +-- On spec pass: dispatch code quality reviewer (background)
|      +-- On quality pass: VERIFY — run tests, read output
|      +-- Mark task complete only with verification evidence
|
+-- 5. Run full test suite — paste actual output
|
+-- 6. ██ PAR: PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE REVIEW (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP) ██
|      This is NOT a checklist item. This is a CONCRETE ACTION you must perform.
|      You CANNOT proceed to step 7 without completing this step.
|
|      BOTH reviewers receive the SPEC FILE in their prompt. Not just "review code"
|      but "review this diff AGAINST this spec." The spec is the source of truth.
|
|      ACTION A: Dispatch Claude reviewer (technical + security + spec compliance):
|        Agent(prompt="Read spec at [path]. Then run git diff [base]. Review for:
|          1. Spec compliance — does implementation match spec?
|          2. Missing features from spec
|          3. Security: auth, validation, injection, OWASP
|          4. Architecture: patterns, coupling, performance
|          Return ACCEPTED or NEEDS_FIXES.", run_in_background=true)
|
|      ACTION B: Dispatch Codex reviewer (product + spec compliance):
|        gtimeout 600 codex exec --full-auto "Read spec at [path]. Then run git diff [base]. Review for:
|          1. Spec compliance — does implementation match spec?
|          2. Product: does it solve the user's problem?
|          3. UX gaps: uncovered flows, edge cases
|          4. Code quality: error handling, edge cases
|          Return ACCEPTED or NEEDS_FIXES." 2>&1
|
|      ACTION C: Wait for BOTH to return.
|      ACTION D: If NEEDS_FIXES → fix → re-test → re-review.
|      ACTION E: Only after ACCEPTED → create .par-evidence.json:
|        echo '{"sprint":N,"claude":"ACCEPTED","codex":"ACCEPTED","ts":"'$(date -u +%FT%TZ)'"}' > .par-evidence.json
|      ACTION F: Proceed to step 7.
|
|      IF YOU ARE READING THIS AND THINKING "I'll skip it this time": that is
|      the exact rationalization this step exists to prevent. DISPATCH NOW.
|
+-- 7. Push branch, create PR targeting main
|      GATE: Before `git push`, verify .par-evidence.json exists.
|      The pre-push hook will block push if it's missing.
|
+-- 8. Clean up worktree:
|      git worktree remove .worktrees/sprint-N
|
+-- 9. If Telegram MCP connected: send progress update
|
+-- 10. Start next sprint immediately
```

## Agent Dispatch Rules

**Implementation agents:**
- Use `run_in_background: true` for independent tasks
- Use `mode: bypassPermissions` for all implementation agents
- Use `model: sonnet` for mechanical tasks (1-2 files, clear spec)
- Default model for complex integration tasks
- Maximum concurrent agents: limited only by task independence

**Review optimization:**
- Simple tasks (1-2 files, <50 lines): spec review only
- Medium tasks (2-5 files): spec review + Claude code quality
- Complex tasks (5+ files): full review cycle (spec + Claude + Codex + product)

## Git Worktree Rules

```bash
# Setup (once per session)
grep -q '.worktrees/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore

# Per sprint
git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-N feat/<feature>-sprint-N
# Work happens inside .worktrees/sprint-N/
# After PR creation:
git worktree remove .worktrees/sprint-N
```

**Fallback:** If worktrees unavailable, use regular branch checkout.

## Systematic Debugging

When a test fails:
1. **Investigate** — read failure output, identify the failing assertion
2. **Identify pattern** — data issue, logic error, integration mismatch?
3. **Form hypothesis** — state what's wrong before touching code
4. **Implement fix** — targeted fix based on hypothesis
5. **Verify** — run specific test, then full suite

If unfixable after 2 attempts → BLOCKED with evidence, continue.

## PR Creation

**All PRs target `main`.** Never target other sprint branches.

**GATE:** Before running `gh pr create`, verify you have completed Step 6 (Product Acceptance Review).
If you cannot point to the PAR agent results in your current context, STOP and run PAR now.

```bash
git push -u origin feat/<feature>-sprint-N
gh pr create --base main --title "Sprint N: <scope>" --body "..."
```

## Handling Failures

- **Test failure:** Debug systematically. If unfixable → note in PR, continue.
- **Build failure:** Pre-existing → ignore. New → fix. Unfixable → note, continue.
- **Agent blocked:** Re-dispatch with more context. 2 fails → implement manually.
- **NEVER** stop to ask the user. Accumulate issues, report at end.

## Completion Report

```
## Superflow Complete

### PRs Created
1. #NNN — Sprint 1: [scope]
2. #NNN — Sprint 2: [scope]

### Verification Evidence
- Full test suite: X/Y passing
- All PRs passed product acceptance review

### Known Issues
- [issues with diagnostic evidence]

### Merge Order
1. Merge #NNN first
2. Then #NNN (depends on #1)
```

## Telegram Progress (when MCP connected)

At these points, send a short message via `mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__reply`:
- Sprint started: "Sprint N/M started: [scope]"
- PR created: "PR #NNN created: [title]"
- Error: "Sprint N blocked: [brief reason]"
- Done: Full completion report
