# superflow

Lightweight Claude Code skill for autonomous product-to-production development. Designed for modern models (Opus 4.6+) — minimal instructions, maximum autonomy.

**Philosophy:** Many AI coding skills are heavyweight — hundreds of rules that fill context and degrade quality. Superflow trusts the model and keeps instructions minimal. Instead of preventing errors with verbose rules, it catches them through cross-model reviews (Claude + secondary provider). Less context overhead, better output.

## How It Works

**Phase 0 — Onboarding** (interactive, first run only). Analyzes the project, creates `llms.txt` + `CLAUDE.md`, produces a health report with tech debt analysis. Skipped on subsequent runs.

**Phase 1 — Discovery** (interactive). Collaborative product discovery: research, brainstorming, product brief, spec, plan. ~15-20 min.

**Phase 2 — Execution** (autonomous, zero interaction). PR per sprint, git worktrees, dual-model reviews, TDD. Reports results in Demo Day format.

**Phase 3 — Merge** (interactive, user-initiated). Sequential rebase merges with CI gate, documentation update, cleanup.

```
You: "superflow — upgrade analytics"
Agent: [Phase 0: skip — already onboarded]
Agent: [Phase 1: research → brainstorm → brief → spec → plan] "4 sprints, 28 steps. Go?"
You: "go"
Agent: [Phase 2: Sprint 1 → PR #1 → Sprint 2 → PR #2 → Sprint 3 → PR #3 → Sprint 4 → PR #4]
Agent: "Done. 4 PRs ready. Say 'merge' to start Phase 3."
You: "merge"
Agent: [Phase 3: update docs → merge PRs → cleanup]
```

## When to Use

**Good fit:** Multi-file features, new subsystems, architectural refactors (5+ files, needs a plan).

**Not a good fit:** Quick fixes, config tweaks, single-file changes. Just use Claude Code directly.

## Key Behaviors

- **PR per sprint** — small, reviewable, deployable
- **Git worktrees** — isolated workspace per sprint
- **TDD** — write failing test → verify fail → implement → verify pass
- **Dual-model reviews** — Claude + secondary provider (Codex/Gemini/other); split-focus Claude fallback
- **PAR gate** — Product Acceptance Review before every push, `.par-evidence.json` required
- **llms.txt** — standard project documentation for all LLMs (llmstxt.org)
- **Product brief** — Jobs to be Done + user stories before technical spec
- **Verification discipline** — no claims without pasted test output
- **Max parallelism** — parallelize independent tasks, sequentialize dependent ones

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egerev/superflow.git
ln -s $(pwd)/superflow ~/.claude/skills/superflow
```

Phase 0 will automatically verify that `superflow-enforcement.md` is copied to `~/.claude/rules/` on first run. If missing, it copies it for you.

### Recommended Permissions

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json` to reduce permission prompts:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git worktree *)",
      "Bash(gh pr *)",
      "Bash(gh pr checks *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- **Claude Code CLI**
- **Secondary provider** (optional): Codex (`npm i -g @openai/codex`), Gemini CLI, or other
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`)
- **macOS**: `brew install coreutils` for `gtimeout`

## Origin

Originally inspired by [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (Jesse Vincent, MIT). Superflow has evolved into an independent skill optimized for autonomous execution with modern models.
