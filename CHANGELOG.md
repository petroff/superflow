# Changelog

All notable changes to superflow will be documented in this file.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added — Reasoning Tiers & Unified Review
- **Reasoning Tier System** — three tiers (deep/standard/fast) with explicit `effort` frontmatter for Claude agents and `-c model_reasoning_effort` for Codex
- **12 agent definition files** (`agents/`) — native Claude Code subagent `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (name, description, model, effort)
- **3 Codex-optimized prompts** (`prompts/codex/`) — OpenAI Markdown+XML style for code-reviewer, product-reviewer, audit
- **Unified Review** — merged Internal Review + PAR into single 4-agent parallel review (2 Claude + 2 Codex)
- **Adaptive Implementation** — sprint complexity tags (simple/medium/complex) drive model selection (sonnet/opus)
- **Codex audit agent** in Phase 0 — 5th parallel agent alongside 4 Claude analysts
- **Final Holistic Review** expanded to 4 agents (was 2)
- **Agent deployment** in SKILL.md startup checklist — handles pre-v3.1 projects
- **Verdict vocabulary mapping** in enforcement rules — APPROVE/ACCEPTED/PASS all valid

### Changed
- Phase 2: 11 steps → 10 steps (Internal Review + PAR collapsed into Unified Review)
- Phase 0: 10 steps → 11 steps (new Step 1: deploy agent definitions)
- Enforcement Rule 3: 2-reviewer PAR → 4-agent Unified Review with `.par-evidence.json` 4-verdict schema
- Enforcement Rule 9: 2 Opus reviewers → 4 reviewers (2 Claude + 2 Codex) for Final Holistic
- Supervisor: 4-verdict PAR parsing, complexity extraction, reasoning tier template placeholders
- All docs updated: SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, llms.txt

### Removed
- `ultrathink` keyword from all subagent prompts (confirmed no-op in subagents via testing)

### Research Findings
- `ultrathink` in Agent tool prompts does NOT trigger high reasoning — it's a CLI-level keyword only
- Agent tool does NOT have `effort` parameter — effort controlled via `.md` frontmatter files in `~/.claude/agents/`
- `codex exec review` cannot combine `--base`/`--uncommitted` with `[PROMPT]` — use stdin for prompt injection
- Codex `-c model_reasoning_effort` works per-invocation (verified: xhigh=435 tokens vs low=207 tokens output)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added — Supervisor System (Long-Running Autonomy)
- **Python supervisor CLI** (`bin/superflow-supervisor`): orchestrates multi-hour autonomous sprint execution. Each sprint runs as a fresh Claude Code session — no context degradation
- **Sprint Queue** (`lib/queue.py`): DAG-based dependency resolution, atomic file persistence, concurrent-safe with threading.Lock
- **Checkpoint System** (`lib/checkpoint.py`): crash recovery via per-sprint checkpoints with atomic writes
- **Parallel Execution** (`lib/parallel.py`): ThreadPoolExecutor for independent sprints with thread-safe queue access
- **Adaptive Replanner** (`lib/replanner.py`): LLM-powered replanning after each sprint — adjusts remaining work based on what was learned
- **Telegram Notifications** (`lib/notifications.py`): 11 event types (start, complete, fail, retry, skip, block, timeout, replan, resume, all_done, preflight) with phone-friendly formatting
- **Prompt Templates** (`templates/`): supervisor-sprint-prompt.md and replan-prompt.md for supervised Claude sessions
- **Example queue file** (`examples/sprint-queue-example.json`): template for new users
- **149 tests**: unit tests for all modules + integration tests for happy path, crash recovery, blocked sprints, retry scenarios
- **CLI commands**: `run`, `status`, `resume`, `reset` with Telegram integration and adaptive replanning

### Added — Process Improvements
- **Final Holistic Review** (Phase 2): mandatory full-system review after all sprints — catches cross-module issues that per-sprint PAR misses. Two Opus reviewers (Technical + Product) review ALL code together
- **Breakage Scenario requirement**: every review finding must include a concrete, realistic scenario where the issue causes a real problem. No scenario = not a finding. Prevents over-engineering fixes
- **Enforcement rule 9**: holistic review mandatory, with rationalization prevention

### Changed
- **Project architecture**: evolved from pure Markdown skill to hybrid (Markdown prompts + Python companion CLI)
- **Phase 0**: added python3 availability check for supervisor features
- **Phase 2**: added supervisor mode documentation, Final Holistic Review step, breakage scenario test in NEEDS_FIXES handling
- **SKILL.md**: added supervisor detection to startup checklist
- **Env handling**: deny-list approach (block known sensitive keys) instead of whitelist
- **Signal handling**: SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown with threading.Event
- **All reviewer prompts**: breakage scenario required for every finding

### Fixed (from Final Holistic Review)
- Race condition in parallel mode: queue_lock now passed through _attempt_sprint
- Notification method wiring: correct API calls (notify_sprint_complete vs notify_completed)
- Resume logic: PR existence alone is sufficient for marking completed (worktree may be cleaned up)
- Template substitution: str.replace() instead of str.format() (JSON braces in templates)
- Repo root detection: git rev-parse --show-toplevel with fallback
- Replanner guards: skip/modify only for pending sprints
- Checkpoint atomic writes: tmp+rename pattern matching queue.py
- JSON parser: ANSI escape stripping, scans last 5 lines
- Plan section extraction: exact heading match (prevents "sprint 1" matching "sprint 12")

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **llms.txt writer**: removed artificial 10KB size limit — per llmstxt.org spec there is no hard cap. For large projects (50k+ LOC), 15-25KB is normal. Completeness over brevity.
- **All 7 prompts**: rewritten following Anthropic Claude 4.6 best practices
  - XML tags for all sections (`<role>`, `<context>`, `<instructions>`, `<constraints>`, `<verification>`)
  - Removed aggressive language ("CRITICAL", "YOU MUST", "NEVER") — Claude 4.6 overtriggers on forceful tone
  - Added WHY for every non-obvious rule
  - Positive framing ("Do Y" instead of "Don't do X")
  - Context at top, instructions at bottom (~30% quality improvement per Anthropic)
  - Self-verification checklist at end of each prompt
  - `<anti_overengineering>` block in Opus prompts (writers)
  - `ultrathink` trigger in writer prompts

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Phase 0 audit depth**: agents were rubber-stamping instead of finding real issues
- Step 2: each analysis agent now has 6-7 mandatory checks with required evidence output
  - Architecture: top 10 largest files, architecture violations with file:line, framework verification via imports
  - Code quality: ALL files >500 LOC listed, TODO/FIXME count, test coverage ratio, files without tests
  - DevOps: Docker `latest` tags, deploy script completeness, security scanning, backup strategy
  - Documentation: path verification with counts, freshness check via git log dates
- Step 3: Health Report template expanded with mandatory quantitative sections (Large Files table, Architecture Violations table, DevOps & Infrastructure checklist, Documentation Freshness table)
- Step 3: anti rubber-stamp rule: "the absence of findings requires proof"
- Step 4 (llms.txt): quantitative audit — coverage % (entries vs source dirs), git log since last marker for new modules
- Step 5 (CLAUDE.md): quantitative audit — path validity count, command verification, new files since last audit

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed — Phase 0
- **Critical**: detection table checked old marker `superflow:onboarded` but Step 8 wrote `updated-by-superflow:` — caused infinite re-onboarding loop
- Model was skipping permissions proposal (Step 6.5) and CLAUDE.md/llms.txt audit
- Renumbered all steps 1-10 (no more "Step 6.5")
- Steps 4-5: "Audit & Update" — model must check quality, not just add marker
- Step 7: **"Do NOT skip"** + restart note + "adapt to project toolchain"
- Step 9: Completion Checklist with step references
- Detection: if/else chain, accepts both old and new markers
- Step 2: concrete Agent tool dispatch with `run_in_background: true`
- Step 6: `.worktrees/` gitignore check + enforcement file path
- Step 3: "do not invent problems to fill the template"
- Step 2: analysis agents must use Opus (not Sonnet) — Sonnet hallucinated LangGraph from directory name `graph/` when actual framework was pydantic_graph
- Steps 4-5: doc audit agents must use Opus + `ultrathink` — wrong docs compound errors across all future sessions
- Steps 4-5: "verify framework names by checking imports, not directory names"

### Fixed — Phase 1
- **Critical**: Steps 2.5 and 5.5 fractional numbering → model skipped them (same root cause as Phase 0)
- Renumbered to clean 12 steps: merged research + product expert into Step 2, added Step 3 (Present Research Findings)
- All dispatch steps now have concrete Agent tool / secondary provider invocation patterns
- Steps 9, 11 (reviews): explicit dual-model mechanism with prompts and collection
- Step 4 (Brainstorming): STOP GATE formatting matches Phase 0 pattern
- Step 6 (Product Summary): explicit APPROVAL GATE with accept/change/block paths
- Step 8 (Spec): expanded from 2 lines to full section list
- Step 12: FINAL GATE with re-read instruction before Phase 2
- Directory creation instructions for `docs/superflow/specs/` and `docs/superflow/plans/`

### Fixed — Phase 2
- **Critical**: Review Optimization contradicted enforcement rules — "Simple: spec review only" vs "PAR before every PR". Now clarified as pre-PAR internal review; PAR always mandatory
- Step 5 (review chain): disambiguated from PAR, added prompt references, parallel vs sequential clarified
- Step 3: `.worktrees/` gitignore guard before worktree creation
- Step 4: baseline tests now have actionable instructions (run, record, fail-fast)
- Step 7: post-review test verification separated from baseline
- Step 8 (PAR): explicit prompt references for both reviewers
- Step 9: push command added before `gh pr create`
- Step 10: cleanup only after PR verified
- Added Sprint Completion Checklist (7 items)
- Merged Debugging + Failure Handling into single "Failure & Debugging" section
- No Secondary Provider: lens assignments aligned with PAR definitions
- "Push back" → record disagreement (Phase 2 is autonomous)
- Telegram updates at sprint start and end
- Added BLOCKED status to Completion Report template

### Fixed — Phase 3
- **Critical**: BACKLOG.md referenced but never created — removed (out of scope)
- CI failure handling: explicit 7-step recovery procedure
- Force-push after rebase: explicitly approved in context
- Doc update: dedicated commit on last sprint branch (not separate PR)
- Merge loop: check PR state before attempting merge (skip MERGED/CLOSED)
- Merge verification: concrete `gh pr view --json state` check
- Post-merge report: enriched with sprint titles, test counts, follow-ups
- Trigger phrases expanded: "мерж", affirmative responses
- PR list source: from Completion Report, with fallback `gh pr list`
- Local main sync after all merges
- `.par-evidence.json` cleanup
- Telegram detection method specified

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Phase 0 detection: explicit `<!-- superflow:onboarded:YYYY-MM-DD -->` marker instead of weak string matching
- Three-artifact check (CLAUDE.md, llms.txt, health report) with partial onboarding for missing pieces
- Rename `docs/superpowers/` → `docs/superflow/` in all paths

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Phase 0: Onboarding** — interactive first-run analysis: project health report, tech debt audit, DevOps/CI check
- **Phase 3: Merge** — user-initiated sequential rebase merges with CI gate, doc update, cleanup
- **llms.txt support** — standard project documentation for all LLMs (llmstxt.org); #1 recommendation in health report if missing
- **Product Brief** (Phase 1, Step 5.5) — Jobs to be Done + user stories before technical spec
- **Demo Day completion report** — product-oriented sprint summaries instead of tech log
- **Auto-enforcement check** — Phase 0 verifies `superflow-enforcement.md` is in `~/.claude/rules/`
- **New prompts**: `llms-txt-writer.md`, `claude-md-writer.md` with best practices

### Changed
- **Fully independent from Superpowers**: v1.0.0 loaded 7 Superpowers skills (~113KB) + own SKILL.md (~19KB) = ~132KB total context. v2.0.0 is ~30KB with 2x more features — **77% context reduction** while doubling capability (4 phases, 8 prompts, 4 references vs 2 phases, 5 prompts, 2 references). Superpowers dependency removed in v1.4.0 (PR #4).
- Phase 0: CLAUDE.md auto-updates silently (no approval needed)
- Phase 0: all generated documentation must be in English
- Phase 0: 4 parallel analysis agents (architecture, code quality, DevOps, documentation)
- Phase 2: implementers read `llms.txt` as first step for project context
- Phase 2: documentation update moved to Phase 3 (pre-merge)
- README: complete overhaul with all 4 phases, interaction labels, permissions guide

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Context weight reduced by 68%** (41KB → 13KB): monolithic SKILL.md split into modular references + prompts (#4)
- **Provider-agnostic reviews**: replaced Codex-specific logic with generic secondary provider detection (Codex > Gemini > Aider > split-focus Claude) (#3)
- **Slim README**: condensed to essentials, moved best practices to separate reference (#5)
- **Fully decoupled from Superpowers**: removed all direct references to obra/superpowers skill files. Superflow now stands alone — origin acknowledged in README only.

### Added
- Compaction-resilient architecture: durable rules in `~/.claude/rules/`, thin SKILL.md router
- "When to Use" scope guidance
- PAR enforcement with concrete 6-step algorithm + `.par-evidence.json` gate

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Codex detection: replaced `which codex` with `codex --version 2>/dev/null` smoke test (binary can exist without API keys)
- Heredoc templates in code-quality-reviewer.md and product-reviewer.md: changed `<<'PROMPT'` (quoted, blocks variable expansion) to `<<PROMPT` (unquoted, allows `$(git diff ...)` to expand)

### Added
- Provider-agnostic review fallback: when Codex is unavailable, dispatch TWO Claude agents with split focus (technical + product) instead of skipping reviews
- macOS timeout fallback: `perl -e 'alarm N; exec @ARGV'` as universal fallback when neither `timeout` nor `gtimeout` is available. All timeout references now use `$TIMEOUT_CMD` variable
- Timeout Helper section in SKILL.md with startup detection snippet (gtimeout > timeout > perl fallback)
- `mkdir -p` for spec and plan directories before writing files (prevents failure on first run)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **ultrathink reasoning**: spec review, plan review, and product acceptance prompts now use `ultrathink` for extended thinking, regardless of user's default reasoning effort
- **Codex in brainstorming**: Codex dispatched as Product Expert during Phase 1 brainstorming (parallel with Claude conversation) — two AI models produce more diverse ideas
- **Recommended launch section**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous execution, reasoning effort guidance (high/max + ultrathink)
- **Model strategy table**: detailed per-task model and reasoning recommendations (Opus for planning/review, Sonnet for implementation)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Codex CLI invocation: updated from `codex --approval-mode full-auto --quiet -p` to `codex exec --full-auto` (new Codex CLI API)
- macOS compatibility: use `gtimeout` from coreutils instead of `timeout`
- PR base strategy: all PRs now target `main` to prevent auto-close on squash merge
- Superpowers attribution: corrected to community project (obra/superpowers), not official Anthropic

### Added
- Product Acceptance Review enforcement: marked as NON-NEGOTIABLE with 6-step checklist
- Mandatory self-reminder loop: sprint completion checklist before PR creation
- Checkpoint re-read after each sprint completion

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Initial release
- Two-phase workflow: collaborative product discovery + autonomous execution
- PR-per-sprint with git worktrees
- Dual-model reviews (Claude + Codex)
- Product acceptance review stage
- Context drift prevention
- 5 prompt templates (implementer, spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer, product-reviewer, testing-guidelines)
