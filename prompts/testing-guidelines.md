# Testing Guidelines

```
<role>
This is a testing reference included in implementer context. Follow these guidelines when writing and reviewing tests.
</role>

<context>
These guidelines exist because the most common test failures in code review are not missing tests — they are tests that pass without actually verifying anything. The rules below prevent that class of problem.
</context>

<instructions>
## TDD Cycle

1. Write ONE failing test.
2. Run it — confirm it fails for the right reason (an assertion failure, not a syntax or import error).
3. Write minimal code to pass.
4. Run it — confirm it passes.
5. Refactor if needed.
6. Repeat.

Step 2 is required every time. A test that was never seen to fail has never proven it can catch a bug.

## Mock vs Real

Use this table to decide whether to mock a dependency or use the real one:

| Dependency | Approach |
|---|---|
| Internal utils | Real (never mock) |
| Database (test DB available) | Real (transaction rollback) |
| Database (no test DB) | Mock repository layer |
| External HTTP APIs | Mock (recorded responses) |
| File system | Real (temp dirs, cleanup after) |
| Time/dates | Inject clock |
| Random values | Inject seed |
| Env vars | Set in setup, restore in teardown |
</instructions>

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these patterns. Each one is listed with the reason it causes problems.

1. **Testing mocks instead of behavior** — Asserting that a mock was called with specific arguments only proves your code talks to the mock, not that the system produces correct output. Verify system output instead.

2. **Test-only methods** — Adding public methods solely for test access bloats the API surface and couples tests to internals. Test through the public API; if that is difficult, the design likely needs adjustment.

3. **Tautological tests** — Mocking the function under test makes the test pass regardless of implementation. The test asserts nothing about real behavior.

4. **Over-mocking** — Mocking internal dependencies makes tests brittle to refactors and hides integration bugs. Mock only at system boundaries (external APIs, third-party services). Use real implementations for internal code.

5. **Snapshot abuse** — Asserting against entire HTML or JSON blobs makes tests fragile to irrelevant changes. Assert specific properties that matter to the behavior under test.

6. **Testing implementation details** — Asserting on internal state, private method calls, or execution order ties tests to the current implementation. Test observable behavior: given these inputs, expect these outputs.

7. **Skipping failure verification** — A test that was never seen to fail may be tautological or misconfigured. Every test must be observed in its failing (red) state before trusting its passing (green) state.

When reviewing tests, check:
- [ ] Each test was seen to fail before passing
- [ ] Tests verify observable outputs, not mock interactions
- [ ] Mocks are only used at system boundaries (see Mock vs Real table)
- [ ] No test-only methods were added to production code
- [ ] Assertions target specific properties, not full snapshots
