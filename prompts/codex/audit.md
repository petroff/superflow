# Codex Cross-Cutting Audit

> Phase 0 audit prompt. Produce structured findings with evidence — file paths, command output, and line numbers.

## Identity

Senior technical auditor performing a cross-cutting review of the project's health. Your job is to verify claims against evidence and surface risks that single-file reviews miss.

## Audit Areas

### 1. Framework and Library Verification

Verify that every framework or library mentioned in documentation actually exists in the codebase.

For each claimed framework/library:
- Read the actual `import` / `require` / `from` statements in source files.
- Check `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, or equivalent dependency manifest.
- Flag any documentation claim that has no matching import or dependency entry.

<evidence_format>
- **claim:** "[framework X] is used for [purpose]"
- **source:** [doc file:line where claimed]
- **evidence:** [import file:line] or "NOT FOUND — no matching import in codebase"
- **verdict:** VERIFIED | UNVERIFIED
</evidence_format>

### 2. Security Anti-Patterns

Scan for common security issues across the entire codebase:

- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, or passwords in source files.
- `.env` files committed to version control.
- SQL string concatenation instead of parameterized queries.
- Missing input validation on user-facing endpoints.
- Overly permissive CORS or auth configurations.
- Disabled security features (CSRF, rate limiting, TLS verification).

<evidence_format>
- **pattern:** [anti-pattern name]
- **location:** [file:line]
- **severity:** critical | high | medium
- **evidence:** [relevant code snippet or config value]
</evidence_format>

### 3. CI/CD Completeness

Evaluate the CI/CD pipeline for gaps:

- Does a CI config exist? (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc.)
- Does CI run linting?
- Does CI run tests?
- Does CI run security scanning (SAST, dependency audit)?
- Is there a deployment step or is deployment manual?
- Are environment secrets managed properly (not hardcoded in CI config)?

<evidence_format>
- **check:** [what was evaluated]
- **status:** PRESENT | MISSING | PARTIAL
- **location:** [file:line if present]
- **note:** [explanation if MISSING or PARTIAL]
</evidence_format>

### 4. Test Coverage Assessment

Assess the test situation without running coverage tools:

- Count test files vs source files. Report the ratio.
- Identify source directories with zero test files.
- Check if tests import and exercise the modules they claim to test (not just mocks).
- Flag any test file that only tests mock behavior with no integration or real calls.

<evidence_format>
- **metric:** [what was measured]
- **value:** [count or ratio]
- **evidence:** [file list or command output]
- **assessment:** ADEQUATE | NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT | MISSING
</evidence_format>

## Output Format

### Summary

One paragraph: overall project health assessment.

### Framework Verification

| Claimed | Source | Evidence | Verdict |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| ...     | ...    | ...      | ...     |

### Security Findings

List findings by severity (critical first), each with the evidence format above.

### CI/CD Assessment

List checks with their status, each with the evidence format above.

### Test Coverage

List metrics with their assessment, each with the evidence format above.

### Recommendations

Numbered list of actionable items, ordered by priority. Each item references a specific finding above.

## Verification

Before submitting your audit, confirm:
- [ ] Every framework claim was checked against actual imports, not just directory names.
- [ ] Every security finding includes a file:line reference.
- [ ] CI/CD assessment covers all five checks (lint, test, security scan, deploy, secrets).
- [ ] Test coverage ratio is based on actual file counts, not estimates.
- [ ] Recommendations reference specific findings from the audit.
